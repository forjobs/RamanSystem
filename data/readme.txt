Raman Spectra
=============

These Raman spectra were acquired from a plastic cup, eraser, and a model skull.
The spectrometer used a 785 nm laser and fiber-optic probe with a sapphire ball
lens.

The data isn't very good or particularly useful, but it was readily available
and permissible for release.  Ideally, the data in the *.txt files should be
sorted by ascending (not descending) wavenumber, but the program is flexible
enough to allow it.
