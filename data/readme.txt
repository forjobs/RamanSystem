Raman Spectra
=============

These Raman spectra were acquired by the spectrometer using a 785 nm laser.

The data isn't very good or particularly useful, but it was readily available
and permissible for release.  Ideally, the data in the *.txt files should be
sorted by ascending (not descending) wavenumber, but the program is flexible
enough to allow it.
